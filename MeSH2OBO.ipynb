    "# How to convert MeSH Terminology to OBO\n",

    "### About MeSH\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary for the purpose of indexing journal articles and books in the life sciences; it serves as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Created and updated by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), it is used by the MEDLINE/PubMed article database and by NLM's catalog of book holdings. MeSH is also used by ClinicalTrials.gov registry to classify which diseases are studied by trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. [Source: Wikipedia]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download MeSH\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the MeSH ASCII format for conversion to OBO. You can find the downloadable file [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html) (in 2018, the required file was named d2018.bin).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Okay, let's start now\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start now. We will consider the following MeSH elements:\n",
    " - Unique IDs (UI)\n",
    " - Main Headings (MH)\n",
    " - Entry Terms (EN), and \n",
    " - Hierarchies (TN). \n",
    " \n",
    "But first of all, we need to complement the top-level concepts of MeSH. I don't know why MeSH doesn't include them. One day I'll ask for it,  but for now we'll hardcode it."

It uses unique IDs to display the parent nodes. We therefore build a list from which we can use the tree ID to determine the parent's unique ID. \n",
